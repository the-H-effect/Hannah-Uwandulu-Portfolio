## My Data Analytics Project Portfolio

As a new Immigrant to Canada, I always have to dash to Google whenever I come across  *a concept or language* that might be a part of the culture for Canadians, but completely strange to me as a newbie. I would be listening to the news or reading an article *(mostly the comments section ðŸ˜Š)*, and comments will reference history that I have no clue about. 

*This is the inspiration behind the topics I chose to explore for my Data Analytics Project Portfolio.* 

While I want to showcase my data journey from when I thought data analysis was all about *entering data into excel spreadsheet* to how I am currently building my skills in *ETL and Visualization processes*, I am also interested in researching on Canada's history, trends, culture, environment,...the vast data all around.... 

My Data analytics projects covers Important insights and trends in *Health Sector, Transit Systems, Crime Statistics, Population Census, Wildfires, Housing Prices, Oil Sands Mining, Energy prices, Historical Data on Canadian Disasters* and much more. 

Exploring these uniquely different industries is one way to showcase the first step of the *CRISP-DM*, were *Business Understanding is crucial to Data Understanding, Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and finally Deployment*. 

I am open to new opportunities (**my skills are: Data ETL, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Visual Studio SSAS & SSIS, Advanced Excel Functions & Formulas**), where I can start making meaningful contributions to Canada's economy through Data-Driven Decisions, irrespective of the Business / Industry.


## [Project 1: Alberta Health Services](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Analysis-Alberta-Health-Services)

The full project on the analysis of Alberta Health Services can be found [Here](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Analysis-Alberta-Health-Services).

The following main concepts defined the analysis:
* _There are 5 zones under Alberta Health Services AHS; South (Zone 1), Calgary (Zone 2), Central (Zone 3), Edmonton (Zone 4) and North (Zone 5)._
* _Each AHS Zone is made up of Primary Care Networks (PCN), and each PCN has a number of Primary Care providers._
* _AHS has up to 30 Physician Specialty in addition to General Physicians/ Family Physicians._

#### Visualization
The Visualizations created explored 3 main teams; 
 1. Primary Care Network (PCN) under each AHS Zone, 
 2. Top 5 Cause of Death in Alberta, and 
 3. AHS Physician Specialty.

## [Project 2: Edmonton's Crime Statistics](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Analysis-Edmonton-Crime-Statistics)


Edmonton Crime statistics was analyzed for a 10 year period of 2009 to 2019. 
_Full Report [Here](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Analysis-Edmonton-Crime-Statistics)._

The following indicators was analyzed to give valuable trends and insights.
* _Violent crime: Homicide, Sexual assault, Assault and Robbery,_
* _Property crime: Break & Enter, Theft of vehicle, Theft from vehicle and Theft over $5,000,_
* _Social Disorders,_
* _Domestic violence, and_ 
* _Impaired driving incidents._

Other important indicators and KPIs analyzed are Crime Severity Index (CSI), Weighted Clearance Rate (WCR), Calls received by emergency services, and Complaint/Satisfaction Percentage. 

#### Insights
* The visualizations gives valuable insights on Edmonton's crime indicators. All KPIs showed a decrease for the year 2011 - 2014. 
* Analysis like these are useful in providing valuable insights to Edmonton Police Services to help in resource allocation to the different neighborhoods, and to put preventive measures in place to make for a safer city.

## [Project 3: Britain's Railway System](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Analysis-of-Britain-Railway-System) 

British Railway system made up of Private Franchised Train Operating Companies (TOC) was analyzed with a focus on Virgin Trains franchise. _Full Report [Here](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Analysis-of-Britain-Railway-System)._ 

One of the critical stages of any Data analysis project is understanding the available data, and the relationships that exists between the various business concepts. Based on Data Understanding the following concepts was analyzed:
* _Train operating companies,_
* _Their Usage,_
* _Passenger experience,_
* _Train performance,_
* _Finance, and_
* _Health and safety._

The focus of my analysis was on Virginâ€™s West Coast Route, to identify and show insights in the number of passengers, and the PPM score, and predict passenger growth and train performance based on 10-year historic data.

#### Steps
* Data Extraction, Transformation and Load **(ETL)**
* Load dataset into SQL Server management studio **(SSMS)**, using SQL Server Import and Export Wizard
* Create a Dimensional model with Dimensions and Facts using Visual studio integration services **(SSIS)**. 

#### Deep Dive
* The _number of passenger trips_ for West Coast increased from **30 to 37 million** from Year 2011 to 2019
* The _PPM score_ showed a decrease from **86% to 80%**.
* Comparison of Virgin Train (West Coast Route) to other TOCs was carried out through **Excel PivotTable and PivotCharts**
* **Excel Forecast** function was used to predict Virginâ€™s Number of Passengers and PPM score for the next 2 years.

## [Project 4: Canadaâ€™s Disaster Database] (https://github.com/the-H-effect/Canada-Disaster-Database)

The full project on Canadaâ€™s Disaster Database Analysis can be found [Here](https://github.com/the-H-effect/Canada-Disaster-Database).

#### The Business and The Data
Disasters can have impact on people, economy, government, and policies. Data on natural disasters can be useful for analysis to support research, develop polices, assess damage, mange risk, inform decision-making, and provide emergency response planning and preparation.
The following questions will be analyzed, and insights generated to support the answers.
* _How many natural disasters have occurred since 1900? Organize the disaster by event._
* _How many fatalities have occurred since 1900? Organize the fatalities by event._
* _What is the estimated cost of disasters since 1900? Organize the disaster by event and provide a subtotal of the disasters per year._
* _What percentage of all disasters (100%) were human-made?_
* _What is the next forecasted natural disaster?_
* _When is the next forecasted human-made disaster?_
* _Run 1,000,000 simulations for disasters_

#### Visualization and Insights
