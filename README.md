## My Data Analytics Project Portfolio

As a new Immigrant to Canada, I always have to dash to Google whenever I come across a **concept** that might be a part of the culture for Canadians, but completely strange to me as a newbie. I would be listening to the news or reading an article *(mostly the comments section ðŸ˜Š)*, and people will be talking about a term that I have no clue about. 

**This is the inspiration behind the topics I chose to explore for my Data Analytics Project Portfolio.** 

While I want to showcase my data journey from when I thought data analysis was all about **entering data into excel spreadsheet** to how I am currently building my skills in **ETL and Visualization processes**, I am also interested in researching on trends in Canada, those things that are important to new immigrants that others might just take for granted. 

My Data analytics projects covers Important insights and trends in **Canada's** *Health Sector, Transit Systems, Crime Statistics, Population Census, Wildfires, Housing Prices, Oil Sands Mining, Energy prices, Historical Data on Canadian Disasters* and much more. 

**I invite you to check out my repositories on the analysis I carried out on these different subjects.**

Exploring these uniquely different industries is one way to showcase the first step of the **CRISP-DM**, were *Business Understanding is crucial to Data Understanding, Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and finally Deployment*. 

I am open to new opportunities **(Skills: ETL, SQL, PowerBI, & Tableau)**, where I can start making meaningful contributions to Canada's economy through Data-Driven Decisions, irrespective of the Business / Industry.
